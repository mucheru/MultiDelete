In this example, i simply created "products" table with id, name, details, created_at and updated_at columns. I also added mysql query for add dummy records. Here i use jquery for select all checkboxs and delete all records.

Step 1: Create products Table
Step 2: Create new Routes

Step 3: Add ProductController(App/Http/Controllers)
Step 4: Add Blade File(resource/views/products)
